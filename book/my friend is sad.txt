Narrator Gerald (Elephant) Piggie
Gerald: Ohhh….. (He looks sad.)
Piggie: (to audience) My friend is sad. I will make him happy!
Narrator: Piggie hops away. A cowboy arrives!
Piggie: (riding around, like a cowboy) Yee haw!
Gerald: A cowboy! Ohhh…
Piggie: Gerald loves cowboys. But he is still sad.
Narrator: The cowboy hops away. A clown arrives!
Piggie: (juggling like a clown) I love to juggle!
Gerald: A clown! Ohhh….
Piggie: Clowns are funny. But he is still sad.
Narrator: The clown hops away. A robot arrives!
Gerald: A robot! Ohhh….
Piggie: How can anyone be sad around a robot?
Narrator: The robot hops away. Gerald is soooo sad! Piggie arrives.
Gerald: Piggie!
Piggie:Gerald, I am sorry. I wanted to make you happy. But you are still
sad.
Gerald: I am not sad now. I am happy!
Piggie:You are happy?
Gerald: I am happy because you are here!
But I was so sad, so VERY SAD!
